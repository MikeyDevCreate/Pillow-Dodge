# Pillow-Dodge
A endless dodging game with menus and interactable items made with Pygame and Python in around a week.

The textures in the I game I drew in MS paint and the sounds were made using SFXR.
You can download the EXE for this game here: https://mikeydevstuff.itch.io/pillow-dodge

Instructions on how to play (from the source):
1. Download the latest version of Python onto your PC
2. Go into your terminal and type "pip install pygame" or "pip3 install pygame" if you are on Linux.
3. Download the source code.
4. Extract it.
5. Go into the extracted folder and in there click the folder "src".
6. Double-click on "main.py", and that should launch it.
7. Enjoy it!
